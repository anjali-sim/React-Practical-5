# React-Practical-5

- In this, I have fetched the dynamic data from an API for the user list.
- I have used redux and middleware in this.
- I have created the action, store and reducer for it. 
- There are total 2 pages in the website and for each page the data is fetched from the API.
- I have included buttons for navigating between the pages.

## :sparkles: Functionalities:
1. The user list data is fetched from the API.
2. The user can navigate between two pages with the list of data coming dynamically.
3. I have included the hover effect as well. When the user hovers on any particular data in the list, then its details will be displayed on a card.
4. The dropdown of the user list can be changed.
